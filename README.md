Added support for row swapping, transpose,  Matrix multiplication, addition and scalar multiplication and comparison with Matrices of complex numbers , fractions and doubles.</br>
</br>
Other matrix methods not yet supported by types other than double, .trace(); isRowZero() isColZero()</br>
Methods not yet made  Reduced row echelon form ; dot product ; cross product ; getCofactor ; get Matrix of minors / Matrix of cofactors; get determinant.</br>
</br>
</br>
Other things to do:</br>
</br>
