# Matrix
Class's for Matrix, Fraction and Complex number objects
done to learn java n matrix stuff ; not useful in any way


Added Fraction and Complex classes to represent complex numbers and fractions.
Added support for row swapping, transpose,  Matrix multiplication, addition and scalar multiplication and comparison with Matrices of complex numbers , fractions and doubles.
Other matrix methods not yet supported by types other than double, .trace(); isRowZero() isColZero()
Methods not yet made  Reduced row echelon form ; dot product ; cross product ; getCofactor ; get Matrix of minors / Matrix of cofactors; get determinant.
Other things to do:
1.the methods above.
2.Exception for IllegalMatrixDimensions.
3.Support for exponential functions.
